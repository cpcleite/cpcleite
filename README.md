<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>I have worked with IT and Systems Development for more than 12 years. For a long period I have also acted as Finance and Operations Executive for multinational companies.<p>
<p>Coding is my passion, and I have requalified myself in new technologies as <b>PYTHON, PostgreSQL, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn</b></p>
<p>I started my career working for Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) coding in COBOL and SQL, implementing ERP systems. Then I moved to developing in-house specialist systems in <b>Visual Basic and SQL Server. These positions provided a long experience in Team Software Development and System Test coordination.</b><p>
<p>I later got an <b>MBA</b> and aggregated Finance and Operations experience acting as top level executive in mutinational companies.<p>
<p>In addition to many planning, control and executive responsibilities, programming (coding and BI) has always been my passion. Throughout 20 years I have developed my own <b>Data Engineering</b> programs/pipelines, so that I could control and analyze my companyâ€™s numbers.<p>
<p>Since 2016, I have been using <b>Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and Data Engineering</b>.<p>
<p>I am currently open to working full-time as Data Scientist, Data Engineer or similar opportunities.<p>
<p>My experience was formed while working for many years with VBA, and lately with <b>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch</b>, some of IBM data services (I have participated of las IBMâ€™s Marathon Behind the Code).<p>
